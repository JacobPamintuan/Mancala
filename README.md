# Mancala
Copy of the game mancala using java swing

Final culminating project for ICS3U, first ever real GUI project using Java Swing.

Extremely basic GUI though, its almost embarassing, but it was my first time so...

The only difference from the traditional game Mancala, is that when the game ends, instead of all the stones on your side going to your goal, they go to your opponents. Weird, I know, but thats what Mr. Lee asked for, and thats what he got. Maybe to prevent the player from hoarding their pieces? Idrk.

Might add a feature in the future for the player to play against a "bot" of varying difficulties.
